# Corn-Yield-and-Futures-Price-Prediction
Futures are contracts to buy and sell commodities on a future date at a specified price. Corporations can use futures to hedge against price increases and ensure access to limited goods, but accurate prediction of future commodity values is essential for avoiding unwise purchases. Corn grain poses a special challenge because future prices reflect weather-dependent supply as well as variable demand. My role is to demonstrate how past publicly-available data can be used to predict future corn futures prices.


There are several publicly-available datasets that can be accessed online:
